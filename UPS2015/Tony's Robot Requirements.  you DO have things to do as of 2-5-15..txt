Container arm should
	Have a command that moves to an angle (in OI, we will define what angle each position is).  This should be an angle not a voltage  	<<<< DONE, located in ContainerArm branch
		There will be a button for each position in final operator console																<<< To be done when integrating all controls and mapping to buttons.
	Have fine control on a digital joystick(2 buttons).  It should stay in the state it was fine controlled to.
	Have manual override which doesn't rely on a sensor, and sets raw motor values. 
Totevator should
	Have a command that sets it to a position (this should be passed in in useful units(feet, inches): not encoder ticks)
	Have a command that moves it up or down an amount that will be passed in (this should be passed in useful units(feet, inches))
	Have fine control on a digital joystick(2 buttons): It should stay in the state it was fine controlled to.
	Have manual override which doesn't rely on a sensor, and sets raw motor values using the same joystick above.    					<<<< Ready to test
Wrist should(and I think can)
	be able to move up						<<< Ready to test
	be able to move down					<<< Ready to test
Claw should(and I think can)
	be able to open one side				<<< Ready to test 
	be able to open other side				<<< Ready to test
	be able to open both sides at once.     <<< Ready to test
Drive should
	Have acceleration and PID encoders integrated		<<< DONE
	Have manual override which disables encoders, encoder PIDs, and drives motors on raw input from joysticks.
	Have a drive straight for distance command(which works for strafing as well)					<<<< Drive straight for distance is in Gyro branch. Strafing straight may require encoders or accelerometer
Auto should
	Have a picker on smart dashboard		<<< SendableChooser has been learned
	Be written
